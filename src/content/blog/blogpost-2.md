## BoB

BoB addresses the common pain points of traditional CMS while providing a scalable and maintainable solution for content management. The integration of dependency injection, API callbacks, and advanced search mechanisms ensures that BoB is well-suited for complex web applications and evolving user needs.

## Weakly coupled Architecture

Optimized for static site generation and dynamic functionalities via API callbacks.

We created a composable for managing database operations and used it in a component, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. TailwindCSS was applied to style the components, resulting in a modular, scalable, and modern web application.

## Integration with EinsteinDB and ScaNN

 ScaNN, integrated with EinsteinDB, enables vector quantization schemes and complex foraging searches to be performed on the data stored within the DOM.

## Exploiting Causality

ScaNN's ability to exploit EinsteinDB's relative causality enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of search operations, enabling the application to handle large volumes of data and complex search queries with ease. This facilitates seamless integration with the Vulcan object representing the DOM, enabling fast and responsive interactions with the data.

## Event Handling

Vulcan enables event handling within the DOM, allowing users to interact with the elements on the page. Events triggered by user actions, such as clicks or inputs, can be captured and processed within the Vulcan framework, facilitating dynamic behavior and interactivity.
